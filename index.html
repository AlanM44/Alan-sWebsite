            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am in my first year at Oxford Brookes University, where I've expanded my engineering abilities to include industry specific skills as well as automotive knowledge. Before coming to Brookes, I studied Mechanical Engineering for two years at Oregon State University and gained a strong foundation in engineering principles and practices.</p>

        <section id="hobbies" class="hobbies">
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Outside of my professional life, I am deeply involved in two main hobbies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formula Student:</strong> As a member of the Oxford Brookes Racing Formula Student team, I contribute to the design, build, and testing of high-performance electric race cars. This experience has honed my skills in teamwork and engineering, giving me a practical way to apply what I've learned. OBR's reputation and involvment in the Motorsport industry has given me critical insight into Motorsports as well as connections with current industry professionals.</li>
                <li><strong>Mountain Biking:</strong> I enjoy the thrill and challenge of mountain biking. It's a great way to stay fit, explore nature, and push my limits.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="projects" class="projects">
            <h2>Past Projects</h2>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have worked on several noteworthy projects. Some highlights include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Development of a custom suspension system for a Formula Student car, which improved handling and performance.</li>
                <li>Fabrication of car components through manual machining.</li>
                <li>Steering mounting on a Formula Student Car.</li>
                <li>Various GMAW and SMAW welding projects, including the completion of a SMAW structural welding class at Portland Community College</li>
                <li>In my Maths and Modeling class at Brookes we completed a group MATLAB Project that described the motion of a kinematic system.</li>
                <li>Hand calculations, CAD and Finite Element Analysis of suspension clevises for a Formula Student Car. </li>
            </ul>
